Virtual MIDI Piano Keyboard
===========================

This program is a MIDI event generator/receiver. It doesn't produce any sound
by itself, but can be used to drive a MIDI synthesizer (either hardware or
software, internal or external). You can use the computer's keyboard to play
MIDI notes, and also the mouse. You can use the Virtual MIDI Piano Keyboard
to display the played MIDI notes from another instrument or MIDI file player.
To do so, connect the other MIDI port to the input port of VMPK.

VMPK has been tested in Linux and Windows, but maybe is possible to 
build it also in Mac OSX and Irix. If you can compile and test the program in
those systems, please drop a mail to the author.

The Virtual Keyboard by Takashi Iway (vkeybd) has been the inspiration for this 
one. It is a wonderful piece of software and has served us well for many years.
Thanks!

VMPK uses a modern GUI framework: Qt4 by Trolltech. It gives excellent features
and performance. RtMIDI provides MIDI input/output features. Both frameworks are
platform independent, available for Linux, Windows and Mac OSX.

The alphanumeric keyboard mapping can be configured from inside the program
using the GUI interface, and the settings are stored in XML format. Some maps
for Spanish, German and French keyboard layouts are provided, translated from
the ones provided by VKeybd.

VMPK can send program changes and controllers to a MIDI synth. The definitions 
for different standards and devices can be provided as .INS files, the same 
format used by QTractor and TSE3. It was developed by Cakewalk and used also 
in Sonar.

This software is in a very early alpha stage. See the TODO file for a list of 
pending features. Please feel free to contact the author to ask questions, 
report bugs, and propose new features.

REQUIREMENTS

You need Qt 4.3 or newer. (install the -devel package for your system, or 
download the open source edition from Trolltech.)

RtMIDI is included in the source package. It uses ALSA in Linux, WinMM in 
Windows and CoreMIDI in Mac OSX, which are the native MIDI systems in all the
supported platforms.

INSTALLATION

Download the sources from http://sourceforge.net/projects/vmpk

Unpack the sources in your home directory, and change to the uynpacked dir.

$ cd vmpk-0.1.0

You can choose between CMake and Qmake to prepare the build system.

$ cmake .
or
$ ccmake .
or
$ qmake

After that, to compile the program:

$ make

if the program has been compiled sucessfully, you can install it:

$ make install

more options available:

$ make uninstall

$ make clean
